The NOSPB (New Old School Project Builder) is an attempt to simplify the use of
Gnu Make in open source software projects by implementing metafile style
Makefiles.  With proper implementation, Makefiles should be reduced to little
more than lists of project meta data.

Why Gnu Make?
=============

There are many impressive build tools freely available today.  This project
focuses Gnu Make primarily because it is readily available for virtually every
platform.

Why CxxTest?
============

After reviewing several C++ unit test frameworks, I chose CxxTest because it
fits best with an automated process.  The developer only needs to define a test
to have it become part of the test suite.  Other test frameworks required that
the developer also maintain a separate list of tests to be run.

Notes
=====

Visual Studio and Cygwin:
The Gnu Make 3.81 that ships with Cygwin has broken compatibility with Windows
paths. You need to find a special patched version of Gnu Make 3.81 compiled for
Cygwin that has DOSPATH enabled.

FreeBSD:
You must install the Gnu Make port and run `gmake' instead of 'make'.
